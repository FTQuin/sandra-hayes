            <p>Sandra invites you on a journey every Canadian can take. By digging into her own story, she beckons you
                to come along to reconcile and make new a flawed history that left out Canada’s Indigenous origin. Join
                her as she recalls her childhood, cheering on Cree dog mushers, keeping her feet warm in her treasured
                moose hide mukluks. Join her, too, as she reaches the inescapable realization that she knew little of
                her Indigenous neighbours and that she had gathered her own set of discriminatory beliefs over the
                years. Growing up in the 1950s and ‘60s, she absorbed the notions of continuing racism and prejudice
                against Indigenous people. After graduating from university in Winnipeg she returned home to The Pas,
                Manitoba and became a social worker with the federal government. She was responsible for removing ‘at
                risk’ Indigenous children from their families, often sending them to residential school. Profoundly
                affected by a brutal murder near The Pas in 1971, Sandra eventually began listening to her intuition,
                and followed her abiding curiosity, the wisdom of Elders and Spirit. She was led to advocacy work with
                Indigenous communities and developed a passionate dedication to unlearning and relearning Canada’s real
                history. Sandra faced the task of ‘crossing the river’ between two communities, the mostly white town
                where she lived, and the Cree nation on the other side, going back and forth, both symbolically and
                literally many times. You will be shocked, saddened, encouraged and ultimately challenged to ask
                yourself the questions she asks herself even now—what kind of Canada do you want and how will you be
                part of that unfolding story?</p>

                    <p>Sandra’s words are ripe with the power to burst myths embedded deeply, invisibly in how
                        generations of settlers, including my Scottish/English/Canadian family, justified racist white
                        dominance in Canada. Find it in yourself to be changed by joining Sandra in Crossing the River.

                    <p>Sandra’s struggle to discover what reconciliation means in her own life is evident throughout her
                        story. The various encounters she has had with systemic racism and the continuing impact of
                        injustice experienced by us, as Indigenous peoples, has weighed heavily on her. This book is a
                        great contribution to the new context in Canada. In my lifetime I have moved from the acceptance
                        of colonial oppression to angry reactionary behaviour and more recently I dream of peace and
                        justice on this land.</p>
